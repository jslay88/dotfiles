# Secrets directory - files placed here will be sourced by .zshrc
# 
# This directory is intentionally empty in the dotfiles repo.
# Add your secret environment variables in files here, e.g.:
#
#   echo 'export MY_API_KEY="your-secret-key"' > ~/.zsh/secrets/api_keys.secret
#
# All files in this directory are sourced automatically by .zshrc
# NEVER commit actual secrets to the dotfiles repository!
